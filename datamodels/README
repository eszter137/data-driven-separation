Part of this code is already published at https://github.com/sgoldt/conv_emerge for the paper "Data-driven emergence of convolutional structure in neural networks" [arXiv:2202.00565]
For the paper "Learning from higher-order statistics, efficiently: hypothesis tests, random features, and neural networks" [arXiv:2312.14922], we added the whitened model and spiked gaussian data models.
